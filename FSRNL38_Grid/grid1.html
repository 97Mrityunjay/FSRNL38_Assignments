        Grid is a collection of rows and columns along with margins, and spacing between each row and column. A designer can always tweak the number of rows or columns required and also the margin and spacing between each of these rows and columns. 
        The optimal use of grids serves as a guiding layout for overall designs. It helps to create consistent templates and standards. Using baselines (columns and rows) and padding( gutters and margins) it becomes easy to configure multiple screens at once. Grid ensures a balanced hierarchy of screen elements. Grid systems have different types of grids(which we will have a look at later in this article).
